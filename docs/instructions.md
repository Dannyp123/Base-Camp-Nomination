<h1> # Instructions </h1>



<p>To start the application, the user chooses whether they want to run <b>External</b> or <b>Internal</b>.</p>

 

<p>If the user wants to run external then you run main within the External Class. While running external, the program ask the user several questions. A few are, if the nominee is a senior, what is the nominator's name and etc.</p>

<p>    The next part of external is questions for the nominator. Like their email, name, and phone number.After you answer the nominator's questions, it then goes into asking questions about the nominee, and there are opinion question for the nominator to answer about the nominee. Just like the nominator's, although the nominee's have more questions to get to know the nominee. Once that is done, it will ask a few more questions about the nominee's location and high school attending. Finally, it takes all the information the user has given and writes it too to a text file named after the nominee.  </p>

<p>The final part of the program is the internal class. This is for any Base Camp members to use to see possible upcoming students. You will run this the same as external, although all the code is in the internal class. What happens first is it prints out a list of nominee's and the date they where nominated on and ask you which nominee do you want to see. When you choose one, you type in their name and hit enter and all the information from the nomination process is displayed for the user to see. If the user like what is on the screen they can agree to make an interview with that nominee.</p>
