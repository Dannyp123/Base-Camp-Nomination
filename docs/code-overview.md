# Code Overview

## 

## The interview process for Base Camp Coding Academy. With @dannyp123 and @timothyb9526

We used Java to make the Base Camp Nomination process with an internal and a external side.

## 

##  It has 2 exectuables

**1. Internal.java** has a welcome screen and shows the current names that have been nominated.

- You can choose a name and it will show all of the application questions and their answer. 

**2. External.java** has a welcome screen to welcome the nominator and shows how many questions there are.

- It also takes the information and writes it to a file called  "nomineenames.txt" and also writes their answers and the questions in a text file with their name as the file name.

**Nominee.java** has everything about the student application.  It runs after the nominator's questions and has a divider in between so the user can tell it is the nominee's part of the application. It  shows the student how many questions there are as well.

**Nominator.java** has all the methods to ask the nominator's questions. It is at the beginning, after the welcome menu 

**NominatorInfo.java** and **NomineeInformation.java** are the  constructor classes we used for the 2 different parts of the executables.  It has the instance variables for the nominator and nominee.
