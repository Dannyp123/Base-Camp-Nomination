# Base-Camp-Nomination

<h2>The interview process for Base Camp Coding Academy. With @dannyp123 @timothyb9526</h2>

<p>We used Java to make the Base Camp Nomination process with an internal and a external side.</p>

<h2> It has 2 exectuables</h2>

<p><b>1. Internal.java</b> has a welcome screen and shows the current names that has been nominated.</p>

  <p> \t - You can choose a name and it will show all of the application questions and their answer. </p>

<p><b>2. External.java</b> has a welcome screen to welcome the nominator and shows how many questions there are.</p>
  <p> It also takes the information and writes it to a file called "nomineenames.txt" and also writes their answers and the questions in a txt file with their name as the file name.</p>
  
  <p><b>Nominee.java</b> has everything about the student application. It runs after the nominator's questions and has a divider in between. It shows the student how many questions there are as well.</p>
  
 <p><b>Nominator.java</b> has all the methods to ask the nominator's questions. It is at the beginning, after the welcome menu </p>
 
 <p><b>NominatorInfo.java</b> and <b>NomineeInformation.java</b> is the constructor classes we use for the 2 different parts of the exectuables. It has the instance variables for the nominator and nominee. </p>
